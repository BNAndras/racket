# Introduction

There are several idiomatic ways to solve this exercise.

## Approach: Reversing a list of characters

```scheme
(define (my-reverse s)
    (list->string (foldl cons '() (string->list s))))
```

## Approach: Reversing with substrings

```scheme
(define (my-reverse s)
  (if (non-empty-string? s)
      (string-append (my-reverse (substring s 1))
                     (substring s 0 1))
      ""))
```

## Approach: Reversing by index

```scheme
(define (my-reverse s)
  (define end (sub1 (string-length s)))
  (build-string (add1 end)
                (Î» (i) (string-ref s (- end i)))))
```
